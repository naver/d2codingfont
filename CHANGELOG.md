# Changelog

The archive for every version is attached to its tag on the
[Releases](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/releases) page. Versions 1.0 and 1.1
predate this repository; their archives were re-uploaded when the project moved from
dev.naver.com to GitHub, and their dates below come from the archive names.

## 1.3.3 (2026-07-25)

A metadata-only release. Only the `name` and `head` tables were rewritten; every other
table is byte identical to 1.3.2, and shaping output is unchanged.

- The copyright, trademark and vendor URL records still credited NHN Corporation. NAVER
  Corporation was spun off from NHN in 2013 and is the copyright holder, so those records
  now read `NAVER Corporation` and `https://www.navercorp.com`.
- The license URL (name ID 14) pointed at a dead `dev.naver.com` wiki page. It now points
  at `https://openfontlicense.org`.
- `OFL.txt` is included in the release archive. The full license text used to live only in
  the project wiki.

## 1.3.2 (2018-05-24)

- Fixed the shortened `i` at 18pt in IntelliJ, Android Studio and Visual Studio Code
  ([#70](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/70)).
- Fixed glyph height problems: 산 at 19px, 세 at 16pt and 18pt.
- Fixed the bold lowercase `y` being drawn smaller than the surrounding characters
  ([#67](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/67)).
- Improved the legibility of the empty heart symbol U+2661
  ([#69](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/69)).
- Fixed the tab indicator overlapping the `>>` marks in Source Insight 4.0
  ([#68](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/68)).

## 1.3.1 (2017-12-19)

Re-issued on 2018-01-15 to correct the version name from 1.31 to 1.3.1.

  ([#59](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/59)).

  ([#64](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/64)).

  ([#56](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/56)).
- Fixed the `@` character at 15pt
  ([#57](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/issues/57)).

## 1.3 (2017-11-29)

- Improved legibility of the ㅂ final consonant, of single against double quotation marks,
  and of `b`, `d` and `h`, whose short ascenders could read as `o` or `n`.
- Added powerline symbols.
- Added programming ligatures for common operator sequences through the OpenType `calt`
  feature.
- Fixed the font not appearing in some development tools; verified on Windows 7/10,
  OS X 10.7 through macOS 10.12, and Ubuntu 14/16 across the common editors and IDEs.

## 1.2 (2016-10-21)

- Added 31 control pictures (arrows, boxes and the other ASCII control characters).

## 1.1 (2015-11-03)

## 1.0 (2015-09-11)

The first release: Regular and Bold, drawn for NAVER by FONTRIX, with the Hangul based on
Nanum Barun Gothic, distributed as a TTC.
