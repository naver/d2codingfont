### Download
   - [Ver 1.3.3 (released 2026-07-25)](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/releases/tag/VER1.3.3)
   - Please uninstall any previously installed version before installing.
   - Older versions are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/naver/d2-coding-font/releases) page,
     and the version history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Try it first
[**naver.github.io/d2-coding-font**](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/) is a live specimen
with an editable playground, the complete ligature list read out of the font, and three tools for
pinning down a rendering problem before you report it: a size ladder from 8px to 24px, a coverage
check against the real `cmap`, and a report template that captures your settings and environment.

D2 Coding runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, and works with a wide range of development tools.

## About the typeface
D2 Coding is based on Nanum Barun Gothic and was optimised for writing code: it improves legibility
and the distinction between similar looking characters, while keeping the Latin design in harmony
with Hangul. Characters that are easy to confuse while reading code, whether Latin letters, digits,
Hangul or punctuation, were reworked to stay distinguishable. It is a monospaced typeface, so line
and character spacing stay consistent in any development environment.

### Clear
Latin letters, digits and similar looking Hangul symbols were drawn to be easy to tell apart while
reading code. Hinting was tuned so that the design stays crisp between 8 and 18pt.

[![One-shaped characters, zero-shaped characters and code punctuation in Noto Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono and D2Coding](site/distinction.png)](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/#legibility)

The first two rows of the capture are Noto Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono. On the live
[specimen page](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/#legibility) the table renders in your own
browser's fonts instead, with D2Coding always in the third row.

### Smooth
Hangul is based on Nanum Barun Gothic, so the letterforms stay soft and blend naturally with the
Latin design used for code.

The same snippet is rendered live on the [specimen page](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/#smooth).

### Even
Because it is monospaced, code lines up neatly in any development environment. Line and character
spacing were tuned through an internal beta test with developers to improve the readability of code.

[![Latin, Hangul and Hanja on the same monospaced grid](site/alignment.png)](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/#hangul)

Sixteen Latin characters, eight Hangul syllables and eight ideographs all end on the same column.
The grid above is the one the [specimen page](https://naver.github.io/d2-coding-font/#hangul) can
draw over any sample.

### Character coverage
1.3.3 maps 19,966 codepoints over 26,188 glyphs: all 11,172 Hangul syllables, Latin and 332
extended characters, 31 control pictures, and 4,620 CJK Unified Ideographs plus 268 compatibility
ideographs.

Earlier versions of this README said Hanja was not included and would fall back to another font.
That was never true of a released build. 1.0 already carried the same 4,620 ideographs, and they
are drawn full width, so they render from D2Coding rather than from a fallback.

A Hangul syllable is exactly twice the advance width of a Latin character, so Korean comments and
string literals keep source code, tables and box drawing output aligned. Hanja is full width too.

### Ligature build
A separate ligature build adds programming ligatures for common operator sequences such as `=>`,
`!=`, `<=` and `->` through the OpenType `calt` feature. Apart from that OpenType code it is
identical to the standard build: the two share the exact same outlines and metrics.

## Sources
The original design sources have never been part of this repository. The typeface was drawn for
NAVER by FONTRIX in 2015, and on a project this old, tracking down who still holds the `.glyphs` or
`.ufo` files takes time. Rather than leave the project without anything to build from, the UFO
files under `sources/` were reverse-engineered from the released binaries with
[fontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) and
[extractor](https://github.com/robotools/extractor). They carry the quadratic outlines exactly as
they are in the shipped TTFs, so they are a starting point for further work rather than the
original design data. See [sources/README.md](sources/README.md) for details.

## License
Anyone may use D2 Coding, and anyone may redistribute it under the terms of the SIL Open Font
License.

D2 Coding is released under the OFL (SIL Open Font License), an internationally recognised license
for open fonts. It places no restriction on use, and redistribution is allowed as long as the
license is included. That covers bundling the font with other software, commercial software
included.

The full license text is in [OFL.txt](OFL.txt), and the same text as it was written in the project
wiki is in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). Until now it lived only in the wiki, which is what made the
license hard to find.
